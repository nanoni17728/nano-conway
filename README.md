Nano Conway (alpha release)
=====================================
Nano Conway (a.k.a `libconway` internally) is my C implementation of the [Game of Life]
by John Horton Conway. It features what you usually need for your typical Game of Life
but also some new features that I would like to iterate on like coloring entities.

It is still in early alpha and licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0].
